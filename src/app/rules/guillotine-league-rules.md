# Guillotine Gulag League Rules and Schedule

## Concept

Welcome to the ultimate fantasy football experience - the Guillotine Gulag League! This 19-20 team Battle Royale will test your skills, strategy, and survival instincts. Here's what you need to know:

- **Battle Royale Format**: Each week, the bottom 2 teams are sent to the gulag to fight for survival.
- **Elimination**: After the gulag closes, the bottom team is dropped from the league.
- **Buy-in**: $50 entry fee - winner takes all!
- **Creative Survival**: Use any strategy you can imagine to survive, but avoid collusion at all costs.

## General Roster Rules

1. **Team Size**: Maintain exactly 9 players on your roster at all times.
2. **Starting Lineup**: You don't have to start all your players.
3. **Player Lock**: Players are locked at their scheduled game time in the app.
4. **Weekly Bonus**: $10 a week for the first 12 weeks (includes gulag/gladiator teams).

## Gulag & Gladiator Rules

- **Bottom 2 Teams**: Lose all players except 2 nominated keepers.
- **Champion Substitution**: Pay someone to take your place, but both take the gulag penalty.
- **Rebuilding**: Rebuild teams through waivers or trades during the gulag week.
- **Gulag Showdown**: Separate head-to-head faceoff, not the in-app matchup.
- **Gladiator Bonus**: Gladiator wins are rewarded with 1 keeper.
- **Elimination**: Loser is dropped from the league.

## Auction Draft Rules

- **No Auto-drafters**: Auto-drafting without permission results in first-week gulag placement.
- **Budget**: Start with a $200 budget.
- **FAAB Conversion**: Unspent auction dollars convert to FAAB at a 5:1 ratio.

## Waiver Rules

- **First FAAB Bids**: Clear on Thursday morning at 2AM CST.
- **Second Bidding Window**: Clears on Saturdays at 11AM CST.
- **Player Locks**: Played or locked players cannot be moved.
- **Waiver Bugs**: Commissioner will handle through silent auctions if necessary.

## Trading Rules

- **Approval Process**: Trades must be submitted in writing and approved by the commissioner.
- **Creativity Encouraged**: Almost anything is allowed that isn't collusion.
- **Veto Power**: Commissioner reserves the right to veto unfair trades.
- **Prohibited Trades**: No roster spot trading to hurt others, player renting at large discounts, or real-life favors for fantasy gain.
- **Allowed Creative Trades**: Player rentals, options on player ownership, brokering trades, and more.
